# Stackover-question-tagging

Data preparation and training a question tagging deep net model using Facebook Recruitment III dataset from kaggle. 
Due to insufficient storage, RAM and Training time, i will use just one quarter of the dataset for training but there will be a folder containing code for retraining and also another folder that will predict the tags using trained model.

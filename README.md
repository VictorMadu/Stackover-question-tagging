# Stackover-question-tagging

Data preparation and training a question tagging deep net model using Facebook Recruitment III dataset from kaggle. 
Due to insufficient storage, RAM and Training time, i will use just one quarter of the dataset for training but there will be a folder containing code for retraining and also another folder that will predict the tags using trained model. 

This is for learning purpose but could turn out to be a usable in the future


# BUGS
In the Training.ipynb file, keras.fit_generator giving a StopIteration Error and i am trying as much as possible to fix that. If you are reading this and what to help me out, i will be grateful :)
